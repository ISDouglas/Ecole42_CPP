# 🧠 42 C++ Modules (CPP00 – CPP09)

This repository contains my implementations of the **C++ Modules (CPP00 to CPP09)** from **42 School**.
These projects are designed to introduce modern C++ concepts progressively, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming**, **memory management**, and **good software design practices**.

The modules follow the **C++98 standard**, encouraging a deep understanding of core language features without relying on modern shortcuts.

---

## 📚 Overview of Modules & Concepts

### 🧩 CPP00 — Basics of C++

**Key concepts:**

* Namespaces
* Classes & instances
* Member functions
* std::iostream
* Encapsulation
* Header files & Makefile

📌 First contact with C++ and class-based design.

---

### 🧩 CPP01 — Memory & References

**Key concepts:**

* Stack vs Heap allocation
* References vs pointers
* `new` / `delete`
* Object lifetime
* File streams (`std::ifstream`, `std::ofstream`)

📌 Understanding memory management and ownership.

---

### 🧩 CPP02 — Ad-hoc Polymorphism

**Key concepts:**

* Operator overloading
* Canonical Orthodox Form (Rule of 3)
* Fixed-point arithmetic
* Copy constructor & assignment operator

📌 Writing safe and predictable C++ classes.

---

### 🧩 CPP03 — Inheritance

**Key concepts:**

* Inheritance
* Base & derived classes
* Protected members
* Method overriding
* Virtual functions (intro)

📌 Modeling real-world relationships with class hierarchies.

---

### 🧩 CPP04 — Subtype Polymorphism

**Key concepts:**

* Virtual functions & destructors
* Abstract classes
* Interfaces
* Dynamic binding
* Deep vs shallow copy

📌 True runtime polymorphism and interface-based design.

---

### 🧩 CPP05 — Exceptions

**Key concepts:**

* Exception handling (`try / catch / throw`)
* Custom exception classes
* `std::exception`
* Error handling design

📌 Writing robust and fault-tolerant programs.

---

### 🧩 CPP06 — Type Conversion

**Key concepts:**

* C++ casts:

  * `static_cast`
  * `dynamic_cast`
  * `reinterpret_cast`
  * `const_cast`
* Type identification
* Serialization basics

📌 Understanding type safety and runtime type information.

---

### 🧩 CPP07 — Templates

**Key concepts:**

* Function templates
* Class templates
* Generic programming
* Type deduction

📌 Writing reusable and type-independent code.

---

### 🧩 CPP08 — STL Containers & Algorithms

**Key concepts:**

* STL containers (`vector`, `list`, `map`, etc.)
* Iterators
* Algorithms (`find`, `sort`, `for_each`)
* Lambdas (intro-level)
* Time complexity awareness

📌 Leveraging the C++ Standard Library efficiently.

---

### 🧩 CPP09 — Advanced STL & Algorithms

**Key concepts:**

* Advanced container usage
* Algorithmic problem solving
* Data parsing & validation
* Performance considerations
* Real-world use cases of STL

📌 Applying C++ to practical and complex problems.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Constraints

* **Language standard:** C++98
* **Compilation:** `c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror`
* **Memory management:** manual (no smart pointers)
* **Norm:** 42 coding standards
* **No external libraries**

---

## 🎯 Skills Developed

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Manual memory management
* Polymorphism & inheritance
* Exception-safe design
* Template programming
* STL mastery
* Clean architecture & maintainable code

---

## 🚀 Purpose

These modules aim to build **strong C++ fundamentals** and prepare students for:

* Low-level systems programming
* Performance-critical applications
* Technical interviews requiring solid C++ knowledge
